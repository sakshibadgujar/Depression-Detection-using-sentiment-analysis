 Depression Detection Using Sentiment Analysis — Weekly Progress Log

This logbook details the weekwise progress of our final year B.Tech project titled “Depression Detection Using Sentiment Analysis”, implemented by students of R. C. Patel Institute of Technology, Shirpur, under the guidance of Prof. Ujwala Patil.



 Week 0: 31st January 2025
 Milestone: Abstract Submission
 Finalized project topic: Depression Detection Using Sentiment Analysis.
 Conducted preliminary discussions to understand the scope and feasibility of the project.
 Drafted and submitted the abstract for departmental approval.
 Tools and technologies shortlisted: Python, NLP (Natural Language Processing), ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, etc.), Jupyter/Colab.



 Week 1: 3rd – 10th February 2025
 Milestone: Initial Planning and Setup
 Created GitHub repository to track project progress.
 Conducted literature review on mental health prediction using NLP.
 Started collecting and inspecting different mental health datasets from sources such as Kaggle and research papers.
 Held team meetings to finalize roles and define workflow for implementation.



 Week 2: 11th – 17th February 2025
 Milestone: Dataset Finalization and Preprocessing Design
 Finalized the multiclass dataset related to mental health conditions.
 Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset.
 Analyzed data structure: 7 classes – Normal, Depression, Suicidal, Anxiety, Stress, Bipolar, Personality Disorder.
 Started designing the preprocessing pipeline (cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization).



 Week 3: 18th – 24th February 2025
 Milestone: Text Cleaning and Visualization
 Implemented text cleaning using NLTK and regular expressions.
 Applied tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
 Generated classwise word clouds for linguistic visualization.
 Created class distribution plot to observe imbalance in class samples.



 Week 4: 25th February – 2nd March 2025
 Milestone: Feature Extraction and Class Balancing
 Implemented TFIDF for feature extraction.
 Addressed dataset imbalance using oversampling techniques.
 Created and stored trainingready datasets for model evaluation.
 Initiated model selection: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, XGBoost.



 Week 5: 3rd March – 9th March 2025
 Milestone: First Demo Presentation
 Prepared for First Internal Demo.
 Presented project motivation, dataset statistics, relevance to mental health.
 Demonstrated initial preprocessing and word cloud outputs.
 Showcased GitHub repository setup and code structure.



 Week 6: 10th – 16th March 2025
 Milestone: Model Training and Evaluation
 Trained all four machine learning models.
 Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, F1score, confusion matrix.
 Observed overfitting in XGBoost despite high training accuracy.
 Identified Logistic Regression as the bestperforming model for deployment.



 Week 7: 17th – 23rd March 2025
 Milestone: Enhancements and Interpretation
 Added probability score generation for predictions.
 Integrated visual outputs for interpretability (e.g., prediction confidence).
 Enhanced plots and visuals for inclusion in paper/report.
 Finalized the model deployment approach for demonstration.



 Week 8: 24th – 31st March 2025
 Milestone: Research Paper Development and Conference Search
 Started writing research paper.
 Converted paper to IEEE LaTeX format.
 Generated citations and references in BibTeX.
 Searched for Indian and international conferences (virtual + offline).



 Week 9: 1st – 3rd April 2025
 Milestone: Second Internal Demo Presentation
 Presented model comparisons and final selection (Logistic Regression).
 Discussed research paper structure and sections.
 Demonstrated paper figures (block diagram, accuracy graph, etc.).
 Showcased publication platforms being considered.



 Week 10: 4th – 7th April 2025
 Milestone: Final Refinements
 Rewrote abstract, introduction, and methodology to reduce plagiarism.
 Ran multiple plagiarism checks to ensure submission eligibility (<5%).
 Finalized and compiled fulllength paper in LaTeX (minimum 4 pages).
 Created visual content (block diagram, class distribution, etc.).



 Week 11: 8th April 2025
 Milestone: Last Demo Presentation
 Presented final outcomes, word cloud examples, and evaluation metrics.
 Showcased completed IEEEformat research paper.
 Submitted paper to selected conference platform.
 Began full report writing for project documentation.




 --Finalize project report and print hard copies.
 --Prepare PowerPoint slides for viva and evaluation.
 --Deploy a basic web interface (optional enhancement).
